## About the language
**History**
In July 2011, JetBrains unveiled Kotlin; a language they have been developing for a year. And on August 2011, JetBrains published a blog post, "_Why JetBrains needs Kotlin_", detailing their reasons behind creating Kotlin.

_Here are the main points_:

**_To increase their (JetBrains) productivity_**
> Back then, JetBrains team were writing all of their IntelliJ-based IDEs almost entirely in Java. It took a lot of time to compile with javac. They wanted to increase productivity by switching to a more expressive language.

**_To drive sales of IntelliJ IDEA_**
>They wanted the enterprise development frameworks and tools for Kotlin to be the part of IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate (commercial version) thereby increasing its sales.

**_Drive company's business by keeping trust_**
> JetBrains is trusted by a lot of professional developers. They wanted to drive company's business as well as attract more people to their approach of developing tools by increasing community awareness of JetBrains and maintaining the trust.

**Some interesting features**

Kotlin is a _statically_ typed language. Here are some of the important features of Kotlin:

**_Open source_**

>Kotlin is distributed under Apache License, Version 2.0. The Kompiler (Kotlin compiler), IntelliJ IDEA plugin, enhancements to basic Java libraries and build tools all are open source.

**_Interoperable with Java and Android_**

>It is 100% interoperable with Java and Android. This means all your current Java/Android code works seamlessly with Kotlin. For more information, visit: Mixing Java and Kotlin in One Project.

In fact, Android team announced Kotlin a first class language for developing Android apps.  In addition to that, it allows you to compile quite a few Kotlin projects to JavaScript modules.

**_Concise and Expressive_**

>Rough estimation indicates that, using Kotlin allows you to cut off the lines of code by approximately 40% (compared to Java).

**_Tool-friendly_**

>Kotlin is developed by JetBrains, a company renowned for creating development tools for professionals. No wonder, it is tool-friendly.      
You can choose any Java IDE to run Kotlin or build it from the command line.
