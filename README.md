## About the language
> _History_

Kotlin was created by JetBrains, a company known for creating
development tools for professionals. In August 2011, JetBrains published a blog post,
Why JetBrains needs Kotlin. Here are the main points

- _To increase their (JetBrains) productivity_
Back then, JetBrains team were writing all of their IntelliJ-based IDEs almost entirely in Java. It took a lot of time to compile with javac. They wanted to increase productivity by switching to a more expressive language.

- _To drive sales of IntelliJ IDEA_
They wanted the enterprise development frameworks and tools for Kotlin to be the part of IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate (commercial version) thereby increasing its sales.

- _Drive company's business by keeping trust_
JetBrains is trusted by a lot of professional developers. They wanted to drive company's business as well as attract more people to their approach of developing tools by increasing community awareness of JetBrains and maintaining the trust.
